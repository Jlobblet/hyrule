Hyrule is open to contributions generally. It's intended to grow with the needs of Hy programmers. The primary criteria for adding a feature to Hyrule are:

- It's not redundant with preexisting Python libraries.
- It's of general interest to Hy programmers. In other words, it's not extremely specialized. Specialized code should go into a specialized library instead.
- It takes at most an entire new file to implement. If your feature spans multiple files, it should probably have its own library instead.

Other than that, Hyrule's `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/hylang/hy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ and core development team are shared with Hy itself.
